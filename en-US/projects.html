        <h3>Lorem Ipsum Generator</h3>
        <p>The <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> text is a very well-known tool in the field of design and web development: It originates from a Cícero's book called "De finibus bonorum et malorum" (About the ends of the good and the bad) that talks about ethics.</p>
        <p>With this project, created to meet my needs to populate designs that I was working on, you can easily generate Lorem Ipsum text in a variety of sizes to better fit your needs. The <a href="https://andremourasantos.com/loremipsum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lorem Ipsum Generator</a> was created with the same base files as my Link for WhatsApp project.</p>

        <p>Because this project used the same base as my previous one, so I could make some features shared between them; for example: when you change the page theme, the theme of both projects will respond. My plans are to make even more shared features between them.</p>
        <p>I also deepened my knowledge in the JavaScript Switch statement, been more capable of identifying ideal use cases, as well as made my previous features functions more logical and clean.</p>

        <h3>Link for WhatsApp</h3>
        <p>In Brazil, WhatsApp is the most used app by far, and there are many apps that use the official API to create links for WhatsApp that guide users directly to a conversation. But, the main problem with those tools is that many of them contain lots of ads or even subscriptions plans to create "premium WhatsApp links".</p>
        <p>Com este projeto, criado para suprir a minha necessidade de popular designs de projetos que estava criando, você pode facilmente gerar um texto em latim personalizando o tamanho para atender às suas necessidades. O <a href="https://andremourasantos.com/loremipsum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gerador de Lorem Ipsum</a> foi criado com a mesma base do Link de WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>The project started with the creation of and interactive wireframe for the website in order to test the layout and features quickly. I used Framer to create the wireframes for both PC and mobile.</p>
        <p>At first, I created the main blocks of construction: geometric forms that would set the layout of the website setted in grayscale to set the importance of each element. After that, content was inserted into each of those blocks. Then, features, like input forms, popups and buttons taken place. To finished the first part of the project, a color pallet and the icons were added and.</p>
        <div class="conteúdoExtra">

            </picture>
        </div>
        <p>After the first step concluded, it was time to experiment with different ideas. Because the wireframe was interactive, creating, deleting and changing its features was easy and quickly I could test all of my ideas of interactivity.</p>
        <p>With the intent to be easy-to-use, responsiveness was the top-one priority and the website was adapted to work on both small mobile devices and large monitors. Beyond responsiveness, interactivity was a priority too, and, because of that, the code was created to be as clean as it can be and easy to update, with many little interactions that help the user use the tool in a natural and expected way.</p>
        <p>The advantage of being constructed by a multistep process gives the website an excellent technical SEO that was built from the scratch with it. The result of such planning and execution gave the website a +90 score on PageSpeed Insights for mobile devices and a +99 score for PCs and laptops, turning itself into a technical success project.</p>

        <h3>My professional website</h3>
        <p>The idea of making my own website came at the beginning of 2020, shortly after I started my Marketing course at Universidade Positivo. My objective was and still is to promote my professional image, work and abilities and don't really only on LinkedIn to do that.</p>
        <p>In the middle of 2021 I started to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, more on that year, I started to learn JavaScript as well. By the end of 2021, I already have sufficient knowledge to be able to build my professional website all by myself and deploy it to the internet.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Nowadays, my website has a video-letter to introduce me in a fast way, my resume totally adapted to view on both laptops and smartphones, all my certificates are available with sweet descriptions about what I have learned in the course and in what I applied my knowledge on, a excellent score of the Web Core Vitals and a good SEO, so good in fact that if you search for my name, my website will appear on the top, followed by my LinkedIn profile. It took time, though, until this day finally arrived.</p>

        <h3>Dr. André website</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://drandresantospvh.com.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. André's website</a> was created with the objective to promote online schedules for consultations. Dr. André is a well-known ophthalmologist in the city of Porto Velho, in the North of Brazil, and, to build up his website, I had a 3-steps plan that unfolded in less than a month:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a website for the doctor, so we could manage his digital presence and promoting campaings online.</li>
            <li>Create a WhatsApp Business account and set it up, so he could talk to his patients (in Brazil, WhatsApp is the top one app for communication).</li>
            <li>Create a continuous search advertising campaign to promote his website.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With that in mind, the path was decided: The website was built with the more up-to-date concepts of the HTML 5 semantic, CSS composition and JavaScript (ECMASCRIPT 6).</p>
        <div class="conteúdoExtra">
            <picture>

            </picture>
        </div>
        <p>By the time his website was done and ready for deployment, I started linking the page with his new WhatsApp Business account. Down below you can see a screenshot of the WhatsApp profile. As you can see, the profile has pretty much the same information that the doctors website. It was very handy, because a lot of people just go straight to the WhatsApp, without looking any information available before in the website.</p>
        <div class="conteúdoExtra">

            </picture>
        </div>
        <p>And with all set, we deploy the website and the new WhatsApp Business profile with a continuous search campaign on Google Ads, so we could boost the first interaction with the website and analyze what people do on it: The website has a properly set up in Google Analytics and uses Google Tag Manager to manage tags and fire tags in actions taken that are important to follow.</p>

        <h3>My Business School's Rebranding</h3>
        <p>In March 2021, the professor and coordinator of my Business School, Luiz Pinheiro, came up with the idea of a challenge for our class: Make a logo rebranding for the Business School. Me and some of my classmates accepted the challenge and we started to discuss about what we were going to do, how it will be done, and when we will need help to do so.</p>
        <p>Our Brand Management professor, Fabiana Mariutti, joined the challenge with us as our guide. And just like that, between March and August of 2021, we completed the duty of making a Rebranding of our Business School.</p>

        <p>We were guided by some thoughts like: "How to describe our Business School?" and "What kind of people do us wanted to target with that change?". By the middle of the project we finally chose a main thought, that was proposed by our guide professor: "We have to see our Business School as the shine start of our University" (adaptation of the original phrase: "A Business School como Prodígio da Universidade Positivo").

        <h3>Um André em Curitiba</h3>
        <p>The Um André em Curitiba page was a project created by myself with the goal of being the "test-site" for the knowledge I was learning in my Digital Marketing Course by USP (Universidade de São Paulo) and my Marketing graduation by the time.</p>
        <p>With that, I learned about how to create a schedule, a script for videos, how to edit images and how to maintain the engagement through the video, how to create descriptions that will attract people and how to utilize the IGTV and its integrations within the Insagram App and the Commercial Account. Besides that, I also learned about the Facebook Business Suite and the Facebook Ads Manager.</p>
        <p>By the end of my Digital Marketing Course, the page and the profile on Instagram were discontinued, but all my work was still online. It's only available in Portuguese, if you want to try your Portuguese, be free and take a look at the page!</p>

        <h3>Artistic Intervention</h3>
        <p>The Artistic Intervention was a project that took place in 2019, during the last year of my High School. This project was the first project of the type in our school and the concept and realization was totally done by our class. We want to leave a mark in the classroom that we study and improve the environment.</p>
        <p>After the coordination approved our idea, we started to organize funding for the project and to buy the items in order to make it happen. I was the one responsible for counting and managing the money, and, to do that, I had created a Coda document with all the information about how, where and when the money was spent. <a href="https://coda.io/d/Vaquinha-da-escola_djoxosOjaCj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The document</a> is still online and it's public now. For the people who helped us, recipes were made and sent to them to help manage everything at every point of funding.</p>

        <p>After just one month, we had enough money to start the project, buying the equipment, tints and everything that we needed. All the costs were also in that initial document and recipes of our orders as well. For every order, the recipe was sent to the people that helped us fund the project, to keep them up to date about our progress.</p>
        <p>We have a closed album of photos of our project for the founders, with all our progress during the time of the project. We also have a poll about what people think about our initiative and progress. This form was created by me and you can <a href="http://http://bit.ly/2BqbnKC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see it here</a>.</p>

        <p>In fact, our project was so big that even the school's marketing team used our work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFFziRpDG2l/?igshid=mzbqbqd1vttm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to publicize</a> the school, but we always remember the people that were us that thought, planned and made the project. We are very pride about our achievements with this project and the mark that we left in the school.</p>

        <h3>WAVE Robotics team</h3>
        <p>The WAVE Robotics Team was a High School project that we made in 2018 in order to participate in the Brazilian Robotics Olympic (OBR) that year, <a href="https://colegiosapiens.com/2018/10/equipe-do-colegio-sapiens-vence-etapa-estadual-da-olimpiada-brasileira-de-robotica/">representing our school</a>.</p>
        <p>We used the LEGO EV3 to make up our robot, his name was Tobias. We created the team at the begining of the year and by the OBR we had managed to get our robot ready for the competition. We had strugle with a lot of issues with the physical part of the robot and had to solve those issues one by one.</p>

        <p>It was a very cool project to be part of and I still have great memories of it. I feel that we have managed to achieve great work with problem resolution and deadlines. We worked instructed by another robot team from our school, the Team of Research and Robotics (EPR), they have helped us a lot.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately we didn't win the competition, but the EPR team did, and we have celebrated a lot!</p>

        <h3>The EMcT project</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://trello.com/emctweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMcT</a> project took place when I was in my first year of High School, on April 24th of 2017. The objective of the project was to help my friends and myself with the deadlines for papers, exercises and related stuff.</p>
        <p>The project was getting bigger by the time and, in 2018, I created a WhatsApp group and an automated Workspace on Slack to make sure everyone had access to the content I was putting on Trello. By this time, I was making a lot of cards with many information about exams, papers, and projects. I paid for Trello Plus to get a Power-Up that automatizes a little of my work and that helps me a lot.</p>

        <p>In 2019 the board only got a few incremental updates, since this was the last year of the High School and the project was already bigger than I was expecting.</p>
        <p>All the information, cards, images, designs and programs I have are available online through the <a href="https://www.notion.so/wikiemctweb/Iniciativa-Projeto-Aberto-ad4f2b7099964613bb04bc19dd9c81f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Project Initiative page</a> for everyone who wants to take a look or use some design I have made. I also made a <a href="http://bit.ly/emctweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki on Notion</a> about every detail of the project, although it is only available in Portuguese.</p>
